#  CS510 Robust Newton's Method Project
## Description
This program takes an input polynomial and will iterate using any of four iterative fixed-point root-finding methods (Newton's method, Halley's method, Robust Newton's method, Hybrid Newton's method) on a region in the complex plane to visually display the convergence of certain points to certain roots.
